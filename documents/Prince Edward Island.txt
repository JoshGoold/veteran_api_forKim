The citation reads – “This officer has completed numerous sorties since September 1941, involving attacks on Berlin, Stettin, Kiel, Brest, Hamburg, and Lubeck. He has at all times displayed enthusiasm for operations and has pressed home his attacks with vigour. One night in February 1942, whilst attacking Kiel, his aircraft was extensively damaged by anti-aircraft lire, the undercarriage, flaps and turrets being rendered useless. The airspeed indicator ceased to function and the fabric was torn in numerous places. On the return journey height was lost continually owing to engine trouble. Despite this, Flight Lieutenant Baker skillfully flew his damaged aircraft to an airfield in this country where he landed with the undercarriage retracted. On impact the aircraft caught fire. The crew managed to escape but the second pilot and a gunner each sustained a fractured arm while Flight Lieutenant Baker’s nose was broken. His experiences have in no way diminished his enthusiastic daring and fortitude.” Detail provided by H. Halliday, Orleans, Ontario.
