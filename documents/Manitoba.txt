The London Gazette of October 29, 1943 gave the following particulars: Flying Officer Trigg had rendered outstanding service on convoy escort and anti-submarine duties. He had completed his operational sorties and had invariably displayed skill and courage of a very high order. One day in August, 1943, he undertook, as captain and pilot, a patrol in a Liberator aircraft although he had not previously made any operational sorties in that type of aircraft. After a search of eight hours’ duration, a surfaced U-boat was sighted. F/O Trigg immediately prepared to attack. During the approach the aircraft received many hits from the submarine’s antiaircraft guns and burst into flames. F/O Trigg could have broken off the engagement and made a forced landing in the sea; but if he continued the attack every second spent in the air would dimish his chances of survival. There could have been no hesitation or doubt in his mind. In spite of the precarious condition of his aircraft, he maintained his course and executed a masterly and devastating attack. A short distance further on the Liberator dived into the sea with gallant captain and crew. The U-boat sank within 20 minutes and some of her crew were picked up later in a rubber dinghy that had broken loose from the Liberator. Trigg was the only one of the crew to be decorated. The V.C. was awarded due to the details provided by one of the German survivors of U468. Flying Officer Pilot Goodwin has no known grave, his name is inscribed on the Malta War Memorial, Malta.

LEWIS, JAMES FREDERICK BYNG LAC(P) 644842 – Royal Air Force. From Morden, Manitoba. Killed In Action Apr.14/40 age 21. #40 Squadron (Hostem A Coelo Expellere). BROTHER to David Earl Lewis. LAC. Lewis took a Blenheim aircraft on a solo flight to Norway and did not return. He had a Canadian pilot’s license but didn’t take it with him when he joined the pre-war RAF. Due to his poor financial situation he was almost forced to join the RAF – but as groundcrew with a promise to remuster to aircrew. The war started and all trades were frozen. He was frustrated in his attempts to remuster after returning from France to the United Kingdom. LAC. Lewis took off in a Blenheim to prove he could fly. He did some low flying over the Officers Mess at lunch time before setting off for Norway. One witness to the event was S/L George D. Hill of Lucky Lake Saskatchewan and now of Kelowna, British Columbia. Leading AirCraftman Pilot Lewis has no known grave, his name is inscribed on the Runnymede War Memorial, Englefield Green, Egham, Surrey, England.

Ex P/O George Pridham of St. John, New Brunswick had this to say, “We were badly hit by a night fighter aircraft so Cliff yelled for anyone who could to bail out. I was hit in the leg and lost it as a Prisoner of War. P/O J.C. Russell, the navigator also bailed out, but the rest didn’t make it. Cliff wasn’t hit I believe but stayed with the a/c not knowing who was hit or who could get out. In 1985 I was contacted by Mr. John Van Vleet of Lopek, Holland and he said our a/c had been found by him and some diver friends in the mud of the Lek River at Lopek, one Rolls Royce engine was taken out and made to look like new. They built a 6 ft. by 10 ft. steel and glass special memorial and put the engine in it along with a 20 ft. wing pointing straight up, all of our names were put on it. I contacted J.C. Russell in Toronto but he showed no interest in the subject. I also contacted Cliff’s relatives at Morden and in 1986 there was a get together there of some of the next of kin of those killed and those involved in Holland.” In May 1990, Les Allison, researcher for this book, visited the memorial and talked to a local man who had seen the aircraft come down when he was 16 yrs. old.
