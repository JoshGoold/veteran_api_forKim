Roy was in 5 major accidents while in training in Canada, in England, during his first tour out of Malta, and during his second tour out of Wick, Scotland. We both must have been accident prone because I was involved in 5 major accidents in 1941 when I flew Spits in England under S/L Stan Turner, Can/RAF, and W/C. Doug Bader the great RAF ace. Twice I crashed my Spit and both times it was caused by sabotage. Once I crashed when hit by our own flak and once I bailed out. Another time my undercarriage collapsed and for the 4th time was severely injured. Because of censorship I never heard exactly what Roy went thru in his accidents.” For a complete story on the brothers see the book THE SKY’S NO LIMIT published in 1985 by Ray Munro.

SPEARN, VERNON ARNOLD FS(P) R153630. From Barrie, Ontario. Missing Feb 20/44 age 22. Les Allison of Roland, Manitoba had this to say, “On Feb 20/44 I was on leave in London, England with my best friend, Howard Kelly of Barrie, Ontario. We were staying at the Canadian Legion Club on Southampton Row, Russel Square and at supper we met FS Spearn who had gone to school with Howard and lived across the alley from the Kellys. We had separate dates arranged for the evening, and, with no telephones, it was impossible to change. We were in adjoining rooms so said we’d see each other after our dates or next morning for breakfast. Spearn never showed up. He had finished Operational Training and Conversion Unit training and was ready for Operations. He knew the casualty statistics and like all of us was scared of his future. A couple of weeks later his parents were informed he was Absent Without Leave, and later a deserter. Kelly and I were called in by the service police as a letter home said we’d all met on Feb 20. We told our story. He was never foundl Was there an air- raid to make him disappear? Or did he, like a few others, decide to become a civilian again. Kelly and I have often wondered what really happened over all these years.” Flight Sergeant Pilot Spearn has no known grave, his name is inscribed on the Runnymede War Memorial, Englefield Green, Egham, Surrey, England.

Award effective 27 January 1942 as per London Gazette of that date and AFRO 358/44 dated 18 February 1944. Home in Toronto; enlisted there 15 October 1940. Trained at N0.1 ITS, No.9 EFTS and No.5 SETS. Killed with No.103 Squadron on 26 April 1942 (name on Runnymede Memorial). Cited with Sergeant Douglas W. Spooner (RAAF, awarded DFM). Award presented to next-of- kin, 22 April 1944. The citation reads – “One night in January 1942, Sergeants Bray and Spooner were captain and second pilot, respectively, of an aircraft which participated in an attack on Wilhelmshaven. Sergeant Bray carried out a determined attack in spite of intense anti-aircraft fire but, when making a second run over the target, a violent explosion shook the aircraft and an ignited flare was blown from the rear of the bomb compartment into the fuselage where it set fire to the fabric, the floor and a seat. The aircraft was now brightly illuminated so that it was an easy target and, whilst held in a concentration of some thirty searchlights, was subjected to intense enemy fire. The situation began to appear hopeless and Sergeant Bray ordered the crew to escape by parachute. He then set the controls and, when making his way to the rear of the air-craft to ensure that the crew had left safely, he observed Sergeant Spooner still battling with the flames. Sergeant Bray thereupon returned to the controls and skillfully and coolly extricated his aircraft from a perilous situation. The flare eventually burned its way through the floor of the aircraft and Sergeant Spooner, having exhausted the extinguisher, finally subdued the flames with his gloved hands. He then went forward and, to enable Sergeant Bray to fulfil the duties of navigator, took over the controls. Although suffering acutely from the effects of the fumes, he flew the aircraft safely back.”  Detail provided by H. Halliday, Orleans, Ontario.

RCAF(retired) was the Commanding Officer of #401 and relates the following, ‘We were escorting American Forts on a raid to Holland on November 30, 1943 at about 25,000 ft. F/L MacDonald’s engine started to misfire and he lost a lot of speed so I ordered the rest of the Sqdn. to go home as there were no enemy fighters around. In radio contact with Harry I advised him to bail out as he’d likely be a POW or Evader. He said; I can make it home. I disagreed as we were just above stalling speed and his engine was damaged. We were over water soon so I contacted air-sea rescue and gave them our position and course. Thirty miles from the English Coast I could see the rescue ship coming at over 40 MPH so suggested to Harry to eject his canopy, turn the Spitfire upside down and fall out but pull his parachute right away. The rescue ship will be there when you hit the water I’ll circle around to make sure. Harry let the canopy go and tried to stand up and go over the side instead of turning over. He was a big man and I think his foot slipped and hit the stick because the Spit went straight down those couple thousand feet. I radioed air-sea rescue what had happened. There was nothing where he went in. I flew home totally beaten.” On July 4, 1944 S/L Cameron was shot down near Caen, France and was an Evader until a French traitor turned him into the Gestapo for 18,000 francs. S/L Cameron suffered some harsh treatment and was left standing on a street in rags and no identification when the Americans invaded France. He returned safely to England and was able to prove who he was. F/L MacDonald was flying in aircraft #MJ 115 for this operation. Our aircraft were equipped with the American built Packard and were giving us more trouble than the real Rolls. On the same op. F/L A.
