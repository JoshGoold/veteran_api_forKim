Addendum: – Air Force Cross – No.168 Squadron (Canada) – Award effective 5 May 1944 as per Canada Gazette of that date and AFRO 1133/44 dated 26 May 1944. Home in Edmonton; enlisted there 26 May 1941. Trained at No.813GS (graduated 30 March 1942) and No.2 WS (graduated 28 February 1942). Incident was 23 January 1944. Presented by Governor General at Government House, 4 July 1944. Dickson subsequently missing with No.168 Squadron, 15 December 1944; name on Ottawa Memorial. Incident described occurred 23 January 1944. Although the incident report refers specifically to the captain, Dickson was part of the crew and received his award for the same action. This officer was captain of a Fortress which was proceeding one night recently from Great Britain to Gibraltar, when about 190 miles from base, under very dark conditions in cloud, his aircraft had a violent head-on collision with an unidentified aircraft on 23 January 1944. Despite the fact that two engines were out of commission, all four propellers bent and the aircraft badly damaged, he managed to right it, after falling approximately 2,000 feet. When they were still unable to hold altitude, he directed his second pilot and crewmen to jettison the cargo and all other loose equipment. By strenuous effort and skillful flying, he was able to set course for land. Although flying with a crew previously unknown to him, he guided their efforts with such confidence that every member performed his function in a most exemplary manner. The flight back occupied approximately two hours of instrument flying, during which the aircraft was vibrating terrifically and apparently on the verge of breaking up. By careful use of radio and other aids, an aerodrome was found and a successful landing was made with no further damage to his aircraft. This officer, when faced with an almost unprecedented emergency in the air, did his job and directed his crew in an extremely laudable manner. Detail provided by H. Halliday, Orleans, Ontario.
